# The Bamazon App
Using MySQL Workbench and npm packages (inquirer and mysql), this app lets user place orders though command line.

To begin:

1. Get your MySQL database up and running. You may get started via [MySQL workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) and follow the documentation listed. 
1. Once the database is running and connected, use the bamazon.sql to populate your product information. 
1. Install the [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) and [mysql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql) packages.

Once you're ready, git clone and run the following:
    cd bamazon
    npm install
    node bamazonCustomer.js
